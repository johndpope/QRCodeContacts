This contacts app comes with basic CRUD functionality, a search bar and a QR Code generator/ scanner. 

A contact has the following information:

First name
Last name
Profile Picture
Date of Birth
Phone Numbers
Email Addresses
Addresses

After you create a contact on the app, you may share it with other users of the app by generating a QR code for them to scan.
Each contact is editable, searchable (name, email, and address fields), deletable and shareable.
