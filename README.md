This contacts app comes with basic CRUD functionality, a search bar and a QR Code generator/ scanner. 

A contact has the following information:

First name
Last name
Profile Picture
Date of Birth
Phone Numbers
Email Addresses
Addresses

After you create a contact on the app, you may share it with other users of the app by generating a QR code for them to scan.
Each contact is editable, searchable (name, email, and address fields), deletable and shareable. 


TODO: 
- This project desperately needs to be refactored. It's a flaming dumpster fire of code that's difficult to make sense of. 
- also, this was my first real experience with Core Data so most of the core data's managed context objects are wrapped around another layer of my own custom data structures. There must be a way to cut out the middleman...
